# Mlflow introduction

This repository shows basic MLflow functionality including experiments, models, and serving.

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bosquealeatorio/expert-octo-rotary-phone-mlflow.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.

```bash
cd expert-octo-rotary-phone-mlflow
```

3. Create the Conda environment from the environment.yml file.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a Conda environment named `flow-env` with all the necessary dependencies.

4. Activate the Conda environment.

```bash
conda activate flow-env
```

You are now ready to use MLflow within this environment.

## Additional Notes

- To deactivate the environment, simply run:
